# LRE integration with GitHub Actions and sending test result to ValueEdge (Octane)
The LoadRunner Enterprise Test Execution GitHub action allows you to trigger load tests on a LoadRunner Enterprise server, monitor the tests, generate analysis or trend reports, and get the report status.
The tests can be pre-existing ones referenced by their ID, or tests defined in a YAML file stored in the GitHub repository.

The ValueEdge (Octane) GitHub actions integration is accomplished with a custom GitHub action which facilitates communication between GitHub and ALM Octane/ValueEdge regarding CI/CD.
